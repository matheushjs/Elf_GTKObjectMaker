pointvec:
	The point and pointvec classes are ready.
	Now we need to bring the figure creator file here.
	Then we need to make a wrapper file that will provide an "extern C" function that makes our global pointvec to be
		converted into a global matrix of 1200 char[5] (possibly) that the drawer source files will use to draw on the UI.

user interface:
	everything left to be done.

objects_drawer:
	We need to make a function that receives a cairo_t and possibly a GtkWidget*
		and paints the pointvec on screen.
	We also need a file to parse char[5] into their respective charmaps.
